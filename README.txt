Introduction

The deoxybyte-unix system provides access to Unix functions via CFFI.

Some, but not all, Lisp implementations provide their own POSIX or
Unix package. While deoxybyte-unix treads some well-worn ground in
that respect, it should be portable to all Unix platforms supported by
CFFI.

Documentation

See the Lisp docstrings, particularly the package docstrings for an
overview.
